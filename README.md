## The goal of this project is to create a MVP for an application that can allow users to recommend their favorite songs to, as well as discover new music from their friends and other unknown users. 


Users will have a profile that is made up of their song recommendations (with associated information for each one). 
             - Views
             - Likes
             - Score that evaluates how well the song recommendation is received

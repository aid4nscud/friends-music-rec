## The goal of this project is to create a MVP for an application that can allow users to recommend their favorite songs, and discover new music to and from their friends and other unknown users. 


Users will have a profile that is made up of their song recommendations (with associated information for each one). 
             - Views
             - Likes
             - Score that evaluates how well the song recommendation is received


## MVP FEATURES:

**- Login/Register a User**

**- User can search any song, preview it, and then recommend it.**

**- User can view their profile and can see their social info + what they've recommended**
